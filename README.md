# Water Invoices Desktop Application

###It is a desktop application program for calculating water bills according to five segments for individual use, whose value changes based on the number of real estate units. I used the C # language and the SQL language to store data, create a database, and link relationships between tables by writing different queries and displaying reports in the program using the DataGrid View.
